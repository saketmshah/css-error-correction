    "The purpose of this notebook is to implement error correction using a Hamming CSS code of type $[[15, 7, 3]]$ with self-dual matrix given below. The idea is to take a 15 qubit circuit, encode these 15 qubits into the logical zero according to the CSS code, apply a Pauli error channel of probability $p$ to each qubit and then to apply the error-correction algorithm. The single qubit perfect corrects any $X, Y$ or $Z$ error."
